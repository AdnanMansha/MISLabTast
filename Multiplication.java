		 * As discussed in last lab. You are required to create a Git Repository and a small application.
			Every group member will create his/her own branch and create a new function.
			 At the end the branhces should be merged into master. 
			 Afterwards, every group member will pull master in their respective branches for the new code.
			  Now all members will make changes in the same function at their respective branches. 
			  Now when the branches get merged into master it would run into conflict mode. 
			  You need to resolve this conflict and merge all the branches in master. 
			  Finally, your code will be available at the Production branch.
			
			Make sure to give proper comments while commiting from stash to repository.
			
			Those who didn't attend the lab have no right to come and ask questions about the basics of Git. 
			You can get help from the students who were present on 13th and 14th October respectively.
